# Base React app

## Motivation

I feel my self losing a bunch of time setting up always the same structure for my applications, so I decided to put everything together and use this project as a base.

Some questions that you might have:

**Why not use others similar projects out there?**

Simple, I tend to use this set-up for side-projects so I don't want to spend too much time digging into other person code.

**Turn this into a `create-react-app` template?**

Soon! but feel free to fork the repo and do it :)
